# Plan for Adding a Circular Timer

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to add a circular countdown timer visualization to the Egg Timer website, enhancing the user experience with a visual representation of time remaining.

## Steps

1. **Plan Circular Timer Feature**
   - Define the purpose and requirements for the circular timer (e.g., visual feedback, sync with main timer, accessible design).

2. **Design Circular Timer UI**
   - Choose between SVG or Canvas for rendering the circular timer (SVG is recommended for simplicity and accessibility).
   - Sketch or describe the layout: place the circular timer prominently, possibly around or above the digital time display.
   - Consider color, thickness, and animation style for the progress ring.

3. **Implement Circular Timer Logic**
   - Write JavaScript to animate the circular progress as the timer counts down.
   - Calculate the percentage of time remaining and update the SVG/Circle accordingly.
   - Ensure smooth animation and performance.

4. **Integrate Circular Timer with Main Timer**
   - Connect the circular timer's updates to the main timer logic so both stay in sync.
   - Ensure the circular timer resets, pauses, and resumes with the main timer.

5. **Test and Refine Circular Timer**
   - Test the feature for accuracy, usability, and visual appeal on different devices.
   - Refine the design and logic based on feedback and testing results.

## Example UI (pseudo-code)

```
<svg width="120" height="120">
  <circle ... /> <!-- background -->
  <circle ... /> <!-- animated progress -->
</svg>
```

## Notes
- SVG is generally easier for accessibility and styling; Canvas is more flexible for complex animations.
- The circular timer should not distract from the main timer controls.
- Document any design or implementation decisions for future reference.
