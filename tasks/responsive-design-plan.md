# Responsive Design Plan for Egg Timer Website

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to make the Egg Timer website fully responsive, ensuring it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Steps

1. **Plan Responsive Design Improvements**
   - Identify UI elements that need better scaling or layout adjustments on smaller screens (e.g., input fields, buttons, spacing).
   - Review current Tailwind CSS usage and note where responsive utility classes can be added.

2. **Implement Responsive Design**
   - Use Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust padding, margins, font sizes, and layout for different breakpoints.
   - Stack elements vertically on small screens and use more compact spacing.
   - Ensure buttons and inputs are touch-friendly and readable on all devices.
   - Test and adjust the container width for various screen sizes.

3. **Test Responsive Design**
   - Test the website on multiple devices and screen sizes (using browser dev tools and real devices if possible).
   - Check for usability, readability, and accessibility.
   - Refine styles and layout based on test results.

## Example Tailwind Adjustments
- Use `w-full` for inputs/buttons on mobile, `max-w-xs` or `max-w-sm` for containers.
- Adjust text sizes: `text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl`.
- Stack controls vertically on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`.
- Add `p-4 sm:p-8` for padding that scales with screen size.

## Notes
- Prioritize usability and clarity on all devices.
- Consider accessibility (contrast, touch targets, font size).
- Document any major changes for future reference.
